**Life Pulse** is a high-performance, decentralized emergency coordination ecosystem engineered to bridge the critical latency gap between blood donors and patients. Specifically optimized for the Kakinada regional node, our architecture prioritizes operational speed, clinical data integrity, and real-time geospatial coordination.

## 🔴 Project Overview

In high-stakes medical emergencies, every second counts. We designed Life Pulse as a comprehensive "Command Center" for blood donation logistics. By integrating advanced location-based algorithms with state-of-the-art generative AI, we have transformed the traditional blood-finding process into a proactive, automated response network.

> ### The 'Golden Hour' Philosophy
> Our core architecture is built around the **Golden Hour** paradigm. In trauma medicine, the first 60 minutes are decisive for survival. We implemented "Radial Interception Logic" to identify and alert compatible donors within a 10km radius of the patient instantly, ensuring that life-saving resources arrive when they are most effective.

## 🏗️ Core Architectural Sectors

### 1. The Emergency Terminal (High-Urgency Zone)
Designed with a "Security-First" UI, this sector facilitates immediate broadcast triggers.
- **Hold-to-Request Protocol**: Prevents accidental triggers while allowing 3-second rapid deployment.
- **Smart Matching Engine**: Calculates real-time distance and ETA for the "Golden Hour" countdown.
- **Patient Metadata**: Securely broadcasts blood type requirements to compatible "Elite Responders."

### 2. Gemini AI Concierge (Medical Intelligence)
Powered by the **Gemini-3-Flash-Preview** model, our AI logic provides clinical-grade oversight.
- **Health Screening Terminal**: Intelligent parsing of donor health descriptions into structured JSON reports.
- **Interactive Eligibility**: Automated verification of HB levels, weight, and chronic conditions against medical safety protocols.
- **Recovery Assistant**: Personalized post-donation nutrition and physiological recovery guidance.

### 3. Interactive Facility Node (Logistics)
A geospatial interface for non-emergency coordination.
- **Live Inventory Sync**: Real-time tracking of blood units across partner hospitals.
- **Direct-Dial Integration**: One-tap communication with hospital blood banks.
- **Traffic-Aware Routing**: Deep-linked navigation optimized for emergency response speeds.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Security

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 (ES6+), Tailwind CSS (Professional Clinical Palette).
- **Intelligence**: Gemini-3-Flash-Preview (LLM-driven health logic).
- **Geospatial**: Web Geolocation API + Smart Matching Algorithms.
- **State Management**: Distributed React Context Hooks.

### Sentinel V4.0.2 Security Protocols
We prioritize data sanctity. Our **Sentinel V4.0.2** implementation includes:
- **Clinical Metadata Encryption**: All medical specs are end-to-end encrypted before transmission.
- **Identity Gateway**: Secure biometric-ready onboarding (Sentinel Protected).
- **Localized Node Activation**: Regional data isolation for the Kakinada network to prevent global data leakage.
